# Portfolio_sitev2
redesign/implementation of my portfolio website

_**To build:**_

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YungBunny/Portfolio_sitev2.git
$ yarn run dev-server
```

I know this website isn't perfect, there are some bugs to be fixed, but this website was a huge learning experience for me. I learned especially a lot about CSS grid, something I was determined to practice once starting the project. I wanted to take the opportunity to get as much practice with React, Webpack, HTML, & CSS. No better way to learn than truly challenging yourself!

_**Challenges I've come across and have yet to resolve/ features I have yet to add:**_

I have found that the parallax effect is challenging me in resizing the SVG when the screen gets smaller, so if anybody knows the fix, please holler!

Fun fact, the parallax effect is also working on mobile as a gyroscope effect. If you move your phone around, the blobs will dance. :o)

The portfolio section has a hover effect. If you hover at the top of the page, it will expose the images from my Wardrobe Styling portfolio. And if you hover under the UI/UX & Developing title, it will expose snippets from that part of my portfolio.  I would like to add descriptions to the technical side of my portfolio so people and better understand the projects I've worked on. 

I would also like to add a loading animation. 

_**Conclusion**_

This design could have been simplified, but I wanted to challenge myself in designing and implementing something that was different from most websites out there. I love pushing boundaries and I know with more experience, practice, and iterations, this website will get built better and better. :^)
